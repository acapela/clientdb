# Intro

The best way to quickly learn how to use clientdb would be to write some code with it.

We'll create a simple 'Todos' client database with `todo` and `list` entities.

We'll cover:

- defining entities (aka tables) of our client database
- creating a database given our defined entities
- inserting into and reading from the database
- defining relationships between entities
- defining default values for entities
